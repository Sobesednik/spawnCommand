# spawnCommand

%NPM: spawncommand%

_SpawnCommand_ will run the `spawn` or `fork` methods from the `child_process` module, and add a `promise` property to the returned process instance. The promise will be resolved on process exit with an object consisting of `code`, `stdout` and `stderr` properties.

```
yarn add spawncommand
```
